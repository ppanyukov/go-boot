# go-boot

The boostrap template for go projects.


Why this is needed:

- setting up projects takes time!
- simplify with this template.

Features:

- some ideas were borrowed from established Prometheus and Thanos projects.
- Go 1.13
- project structure: `cmd` and `pkg` folders.
- Apache 2.0 license.
- makefile with useful targets and tooling
    - `make format test lint build`
    - `make all` (does the above)
- `.gitignore` file with all the right things ignored, including OS X.
- Goland project settings (`.idea` folder).

Using this:

- git clone
- 

TODO:

- make it easier to use
- version embedding using .
